Since after beginning the with the internship task proper, I have encountered a lot of challenges. Some of which I have managed to overcome.
The ride has not been an easy one so far but with the mentors help, I think everything will soon get into shape. Solving some coding problems has been challenging especially when I can't find the right algorithmic solution for it. For instance, in the past couple of weeks I have been struggle to write a snippet(a python function) that compares and return the difference between two python dicts recursively. The two dicts are of different length yet are an output of a single process at different times.

I have googled possible solutions and couldn't find anything satisfactory so far. So I embarked on carving out a way out all together from scratch. So far, I am able to compare two different dictionaries â€¦ for instance to see if the values associated with certain keys in one dictionary correspond to values for the same keys in another. What is left is to be able to get the source value and store them as old and new to be compared later.
